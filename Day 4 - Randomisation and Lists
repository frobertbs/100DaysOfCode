# Randomisation in a programming language is specially important in games for example. Finance where parameters should be random. Or if we want the program to do a different thing each time,
# we need randomisation

# random module
import random

the import sentence can be used also with others python files. For example if we create a new python file we can import it using the import keyword.
let's say we create the payments.py file
so from the main.py file we can import the payments.py file using import payments 

random.randint(1,10) # generates numbers between 1 and 10 with equal probability.
