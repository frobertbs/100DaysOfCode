# In day 7 the Hangman is made using the concepts learned from the previous days such as lists, for and while loops, the random module.

# The hangman game is structured in different steps to accomplish.

# The first step has to do with choosing a random word from a word list. Printing it out. After that the user should guess a letter and print out if each letter

for letter in chosen_word:
    if guessedLetter == letter:

    else:
        print("Wrong")
